## Introduction

The GPS-based Toll Collection System Simulation project provides a framework for simulating toll collection operations by integrating various Python libraries to create a dynamic environment. It aims to give a practical understanding of toll collection systems through key concepts like vehicle movement, toll zone definitions, and payment processing.

## Features

- **Efficiency and Automation**: Automates toll collection, reducing the need for physical toll booths and minimizing traffic congestion.
- **Accuracy**: Uses GPS technology for precise location tracking, ensuring appropriate toll charges based on actual distance traveled.
- **User Convenience**: Provides a seamless experience for drivers by eliminating the need to stop at toll booths.
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduces operational costs by minimizing physical infrastructure and personnel requirements.
- **Scalability**: The system can be scaled to accommodate various road networks and tolling schemes.
- **Environmental Benefits**: Reduces fuel consumption and vehicle emissions by promoting smoother traffic flow.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gps-toll-system.git
    cd gps-toll-system
    

2. Install the required dependencies:

## Methodology

1. **Setup Environment**: Define road network and toll zones using geospatial coordinates.
2. **Simulate Vehicle Movement**: Use SimPy to create a simulation environment and define vehicle movements and toll payments.
3. **Detect Toll Zone Crossings**: Calculate distances to the toll booth using the geodesic distance from the Geopy library.
4. **Calculate Toll Charges**: Determine toll charges based on the distance to the toll booth.
5. **Simulate Payments**: Deduct toll charges from vehicle balances and update their status.
6. **Analytics and Reporting**: Use GeoPandas and Matplotlib for geospatial data visualization and reporting.

## Results

The simulation results provide insights into the toll booth system and its interaction with different vehicles, highlighting the system's efficiency in toll collection, financial management, and geospatial analysis. Detailed logs offer information on each vehicle's initial balance, distance to the toll booth, toll amount incurred, and remaining balance.
